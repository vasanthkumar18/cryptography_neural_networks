# Secure Communication using Neural Networks via Socket Communication 
Implementing Cryptography using Neural Networks through tuning and implementation via socket communication. 

# Breif Summary 
### Project Focus:
> 1. Utilizes the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability) triad.
> 2. Demonstrates an efficient neural cryptography algorithm (NCA) through tuning and socket communication.

 ### NCA Characteristics:
> 1. Dynamically self-configurable.
> 2. Provides a robust yet variable algorithm with the potential for low error rates using neural networks.

 ### Innovations:
> 1. Introduces a new signature/verification capability based on neural network hidden states. <strong>*This feature has not been achieved before*</strong>

### Code and Development:
> 1. The provided code serves as a foundation for further research and enhancements in neural cryptography.
> 2. The cipher is designed to autonomously restore system confidentiality if compromised.

#### Potential Applications:
> 1. Secure communication for autonomous IoT devices.
> 2. Possible use in Artificial Intelligence due to its adaptable nature and efficiency in parallel processing environments.
